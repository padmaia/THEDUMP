# THE DUMP
A social network for your music friends.

Let's face it, most of your facebook friends have bad taste in music or no taste at all. THE DUMP connects you with your music friends and lets you share the music you love, be it from soundcloud, youtube, or anywhere else. It all started with a facebook group, but it's about to become so much more. See below if you would like to help start something awesome.

## Setup
